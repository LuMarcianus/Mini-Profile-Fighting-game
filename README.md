# Mini-Profile-Fighting-game
Using CSS/HTML-based coding for GaiaOnline Profiles and create a smal fighting game


After some research due to lack of advanced knowledge in HTML gaming programs, there will be a lot of novice trial and error to create this mini game.

Avatar images are derived from GaiaOnline.com with preset positions to assist in movements using HTML buttons. There will only be 5 buttons altogether. Of course, there are the movement buttons (left, right, up, down) in addition to the 'Attack' button which will only be the 'A' keystroke.

The way the program will run is that as soon as the link directs you the GaiaOnline Profile Page, an image will pane from the right flashing the visiting avatar's head with the words, "New Challenger" beside it.

This visiting avatar will be facing off with an A.I version of an avatar which we will call Player1. Player1 is a werewolf but, so far, he is human and will be facing off against you, the visitor.

The only attacks that will be done are Hadouken blasts. Players cannot block this attack however it can be dodged through jumping and ducking. The blasts can also be nullified if two of them hit against each other.

While fighting, there will be a health bar to help indicate the future winner. There is a twist, however. If Player1's health bar happen to decrease below 50%, he will turn into a werewolf whereas his speed and strength is increased by 2.

The background image (which is a jpeg of "The Pit" from Mortal Kombat) will turn a gradient shade of red while Player1 is in its werewolf state.

If the visitor is still capable of overcoming Player1, they will be rewarded 100 platinum coins (virtual currency exchanged within GaiaOnline). Otherwise, the visitor is defeated and a "Continue?" prompt will pop up for an 9 to 0 countdown.

If the visitor doesn't agree to continue (or the countdown reaches 0), they will be redirected to this website: https://www.gaiaonline.com/profiles/lu-marcianus/43641675/
